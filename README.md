What I am currently working on?
* My mental health
* My ego
* Not dying
* Not being kidnapped and tortured to the point of death
* Staying alone in my room, typing to people who might read this
* Hudder (My favorite child)
* My website (I have ~~another son~~ a website?)
* Maybe one day I'll give NNUEdit a bit of love ("Ever since you met Zed you have been ignoring me" - NNUEdit, probably)
